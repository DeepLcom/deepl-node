# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## [1.15.0] - 2024-11-15
### Added
* Added `modelType` option to `translateText()` to use models with higher
  translation quality (available for some language pairs), or better latency.
  Options are `'quality_optimized'`, `'latency_optimized'`, and  `'prefer_quality_optimized'`
* Added the `modelTypeUsed` field to `translateText()` response, that
  indicates the translation model used when the `modelType` option is
  specified.


## [1.14.0] - 2024-09-17
### Added
* Added `billedCharacters` field to text translation response.


## [1.13.1] - 2024-08-14
### Added
* Added supported glossary languages: Danish (`'da'`), Norwegian (bokmål)
  (`'nb'`), and Swedish (`'sv'`). The corresponding glossary language code
  TypeScript types are extended.

  Note: older library versions also support the new glossary language pairs,
  this update only adds new types.
### Security
* Increase `axios` locked-version due to security
  [vulnerability in axios <1.7.3](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8hc4-vh64-cxmj)


## [1.13.0] - 2024-04-12
### Added
* Add possibility to add extra parameters to a translation request (both text and document).
  DeepL engineers use this to test features in the API before they are released. Library users
  who cannot update their DeepL library dependency could use these extra parameters to access
  features in the API that are released in the future.
### Security
* Increase `follow-redirects` locked-version due to security 
  [vulnerability in follow-redirects <1.15.5](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cxjh-pqwp-8mfp) 


## [1.12.0] - 2024-02-27
### Added
* New language available: Arabic (`'ar'`). Add language code constants and tests.
  Arabic is currently supported only for text translation; document translation
  support for Arabic is coming soon.

  Note: older library versions also support the new language, this update only adds new code constants.


## [1.11.1] - 2024-01-26
### Fixed
* Dependencies: Update `follow-redirects` due to security vulnerability
### Security
* Increase `axios` requirement to `^1.6.4` to avoid 
  [vulnerability in follow-redirects <1.15.4](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jchw-25xp-jwwc)


## [1.11.0] - 2023-11-03
### Added
* Add optional `context` parameter for text translation, that specifies
  additional context to influence translations, that is not translated itself.
### Changed
* Added notice in Readme that starting in 2024 the library will drop support for
  Node versions that are officially end-of-life.
* Keep-Alive is now used by HTTP(S) agent, to reduce latency for subsequent API requests.
### Fixed
* CI: silence npm audit warnings in non-production dependencies due to 
  currently-unresolvable [vulnerability in semver <7.5.2](https://github.com/npm/node-semver/pull/564). 
* Increase axios dependency to >=1.2.2, due to [bug in axios v1.2.1](https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/5346).
* Added supported glossary languages: Italian (it), Dutch (nl), Polish (pl),
  Portuguese (pt), Russian (ru) and Chinese (zh). The corresponding glossary
  language code TypeScript types are extended.

  Note: older library versions also support the new glossary language pairs,
  this update only adds new types.
* Fixed typo in readme: `createGlossaryWithCsv` not `createGlossaryFromCsv`
  * Issue [#36](https://github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-node/issues/36) thanks to
    [phenomen](https://github.com/phenomen).

### Fixed
* Limit example typescript version to 5.0 due to Node 12 incompatibility

## [1.10.0] - 2023-06-01
### Fixed
* Changed document translation to poll the server every 5 seconds. This should greatly reduce observed document translation processing time.
* Fix getUsage request to be a HTTP GET request, not POST.


## [1.9.0] - 2023-03-22
### Added
* Added platform and node version information to the user-agent string that is sent with API calls, along with an opt-out.
* Added method for applications that use this library to identify themselves in API requests they make.
### Fixed
* Fixed proxy example code in README


## [1.8.0] - 2023-01-26
### Added
* New languages available: Korean (`'ko'`) and Norwegian (bokmål) (`'nb'`). Add
  language code constants and tests.

  Note: older library versions also support the new languages, this update only

### Fixed
* Omit undefined `supportsFormality` field for source languages.


## [1.7.3] - 2023-01-04
### Changed
* CI: suppress `npm audit` warnings for dev dependencies, due to CVE in
  `eslint-plugin-import > tsconfig-paths > json5`.
### Fixed
* Support `axios` v1.2.1, that resolves the issue in v1.2.0.


## [1.7.2] - 2022-11-24
### Fixed
* Limit `axios` to v1.1.3 or lower due to an issue in v1.2.0.
  * This is a temporary workaround until the issue is resolved.


## [1.7.1] - 2022-10-12
### Fixed
* Prefer `for .. of` loops to `for .. in` loops, to handle cases where array
  prototype has been modified.

    [LorenzoJokhan](https://github.com/LorenzoJokhan)
* Node 18 is supported, this is now explicitly documented.

### Added
* Add formality options `'prefer_less'` and `'prefer_more'`.

* Requests resulting in `503 Service Unavailable` errors are now retried.
  Attempting to download a document before translation is completed will now
  wait and retry (up to 5 times by default), rather than rejecting.


## [1.6.0] - 2022-09-09
### Added
* New language available: Ukrainian (`'uk'`). Add language code constant and
  tests.

  Note: older library versions also support new languages, this update only

client library took over this package name. Thanks to
[Tristan De Oliveira](https://github.com/icrotz) for transferring the package
ownership.
